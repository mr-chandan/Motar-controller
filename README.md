# Motor Controller

This project is a motor controller designed to manage and control the speed and direction of a motor. The controller can be used in various applications such as robotics, automation, and other motor-driven systems.

## Features

- Speed control
- Direction control
- Overload protection
- Easy integration with microcontrollers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
- Motor driver (e.g., L298N, TB6612FNG)
- DC motor
- Power supply

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/motor-controller.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd motor-controller
    ```

### Usage

1. Connect the motor driver to the microcontroller and motor according to the wiring diagram provided in the `docs` folder.
2. Upload the provided code to your microcontroller.
3. Power up the system and use the controls to manage the motor.
